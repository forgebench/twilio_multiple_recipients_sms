# twilio_multiple_recipients_sms
A small, lightweight program for sending SMS to multiple recipients through the Twilio API.

To add recipients you can add them manually through the program itself, or in a .csv.
The .csv must have the name or username of the individual in the A column, and the phone number
in the B column.
