# twilio_multiple_recipients_sms
A small, lightweight program for sending SMS to multiple recipients through the Twilio API.

You must have a Twilio SMS account, an activated "from" phone number, and find the Twilio 
account number and auth token at twilio.com/console

You'll fill out your information on the settings page then add recipients.

To add recipients you can add them manually through the program itself, or in a .csv.
The .csv must have the name or username of the individual in the A column, and the phone number
in the B column.

Once recipients have been added simply type your message in the box and click send.
